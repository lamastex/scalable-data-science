LaMaStEx is a laboratory for mathematical statistical experiments that is coordinated by Raazesh Sainudiin.

At LaMaStEx, we work at the interface of mathematics, computing and statistics. This inter-disciplinary research aims broadly to use computers to solve real-world problems.


### More Details

More specifically, our highly inter-disciplinary research at the interface of computer arithmetic and combinatorial data-structures uses custom-built mathematical and statistical models to rigorously solve numerical optimization and simulation problems that arise in statistical decision-making from real-world data.

We have worked on theoretical and practical aspects of a range of real-world decision problems from population genetics, phylogenetics, ecological genetics, air-traffic management, identification and control of gas turbines, natural language processing, collaborative filtering, terrorism studies, statistical physics of complex fluids, cross-domain data-fusion and knowledge-graph extractions for security-related applications, nonparametric self-exciting point processes on networks for crime-risk prediction, scalable geospatial computing of GPS trajectories on OpenStreetMaps, models of transmissions on networks and their inference for meme evolution from Twitter streams, classical problems in nonparametric density estimation, etc.
