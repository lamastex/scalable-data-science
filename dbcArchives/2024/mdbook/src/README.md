## Introduction


A total of 32 PhD students in 9 groups did projects of their choosing in Scalable Data Science and Distributed Machine Learning, a mandatory as well as elective course of The WASP Graduate School in 2024-2025. See <a href="https://lamastex.github.io/ScaDaMaLe/">ScaDaMaLe Course Pathways</a> for details.

**The Best Student Group Project** on the basis of peer-review was GroupProject01 on *Federated Named Entity Recognition: NERF* by Jennifer Andersson, Lovisa Hagstrom, Katriin Kukk and Thibault Marette.
