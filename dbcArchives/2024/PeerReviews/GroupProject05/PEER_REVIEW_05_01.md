# 1. Live/Video Presentation

Score: 2

Great job in general!
I like the structure of the presentation and the motivation behind the project. 

The only minor complaints worth mentioning are the missing units on the plots in slide 13. 

# 2. Structure of Project Repository

Score: 2

If someone asked me where to find a particular part of the repository, I could easily pinpoint the file or directory without much thought.
Based on this, there is not much more I would ask for.

# 3. Comments and explanations in code:

Score: 2

Your functions have reasonable length and as far as I can see, all public functions have a doc string. 
Only the ```main.py``` is mainly uncommented but since it is reasonably short, there is nothing to complain about. 

# 4. Originality or Difficulty of the Project

Score: 2

Since your "group" consisted only of you, I give you two points here instead of just one. 

#### Originality
Continued Pre-Training on LLMs is quite common nowadays, and since it can take a lot of time in general, many researchers and engineers are looking into cloud-based methods. 

#### Difficulty
I can only speculate about the difficulty of the project; therefore, I left these thoughts out of the score.
A quick look at the code suggests that most steps are quite straightforward.
I believe the main challenges lie in the data cleaning methods and possibly runtime performance tuning.


# 5. Scalability of the Project

Score: 2

You stated that you train on multiple GPUs/machines and this is probably the bottleneck in the whole pipeline.
