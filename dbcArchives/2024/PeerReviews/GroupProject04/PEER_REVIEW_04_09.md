# 8. Detailed Constructive Comments

The presentation was nice looking and pretty good, but in my opinion went on for a little too long with too much focus on the results of the model.

The structure of the project repository is great. There are very detailed instructions on how to use the project, and an in-depth description of what has been done during the project.

Most of the code is commented nicely, and easy to follow together with the description in the project README.

The project tackles a very challenging problem, maybe not yielding the results you wanted (if I remember the presentation correctly). The project combines many different frameworks and methods to find a good solution, including every part of the project from data to federated learning.

Overall, the project was well done, but in my opinion focused too much on model performance results and too little on scalability.

There is an accidental duplication in the project readme under section "Classification of objects in the images", something that you should fix.
