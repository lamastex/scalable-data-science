# 1. Live/Video Presentation

- 1 : The presentation was reasonably comprehensible and it helped me follow the codes and explanations relatively easily.

# 2. Structure of Project Repository

- 1 : Reasonably organised and could be improved (please consider making suggestions for improvement in Section 8 below) for easier comprehension.

# 3. Comments and explanations in code:

- 2 : The code was well-commented so I could easily follow what was happening in most code blocks.

# 4. Originality or Difficulty of the Project

- 2 : The project seems to have tackled a very challenging problem and has made significant contributions to aid other researchers or practitioners in a particular domain of expertise.

# 5. Scalability of the Project

- 2 : The project is truly implementing a *scalable data science process* and the same code can work with arbitrarily large input data if enough computing resources are available.

# 6. Total Grade

The Total Grade is: 8

# 8. Detailed Constructive Comments

This is a very interesting application and I enjoyed learning about your project. The README provides clear documentation of the project's problem formulation and provides an in-depth explanation of the complex pipeline. It is carefully written and easy to read. 

Some suggestions for improvement:

I believe that the README would benefit from explicitly describing how you divided the dataset between the clients, and how many clients you are using, in the "FedN for Federated Weed Detection" section. It would be helpful to explain the data distribution you use between clients, and how this differs from the expected true distribution between clients if the setup is launched in the real world. It appears that you use different species for different clients, but I suggest to state and motivate the distribution between clients explicitly in the text.
I also think it would be helpful if you could expand a bit more on the results, especially with respect to the different clients, and comment on the figures in the result section in the README.
The overview of the repository structure aids when trying to reproduce what you have done, but I would have appreciated a more detailed account of how FedN is used, and pointers on more steps, e.g. how to divide the data between clients and setting up the clients. To this end, I think a pointer to when to follow the READMEs in the subfolders would be good in the main README. 
To improve the structure of the README, I also suggest switching the order of the two sections in the main README: beginning with the "report" like part and ending with the reproducibility steps.
I noticed a typo in the last sentence of the 'Introduction' section in the README.

Overall, great work on this project!
