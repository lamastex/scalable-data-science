# 1. Live/Video Presentation


 2 Points : The presentation was easily comprehensible and it helped me follow the project easily. I think I can definitely use the codes in the repository and adapt them if I were to encounter similar problems in the future, with possibly more in-depth self-study as needed.

# 2. Structure of Project Repository

The structure of the codes, including directory structure and coding/software-engineering practices,  were  

2 Point : 
- 2 : Extremely organised and easily comprehensible and/or replicable.

# 3. Comments and explanations in code:

Choose one of the following options:

- 2 : The code was well-commented so I could easily follow what was happening in most code blocks.

# 4. Originality or Difficulty of the Project

Choose one of the following options:

- 1 : The project is similar to an existing openly available project but significant contributions seem to be made in software versions, data used, explanations given and conclusions reached.

# 5. Scalability of the Project


- 2 points: The project is truly implementing a *scalable data science process* and the same code can work with arbitrarily large input data if enough computing resources are available.

# 6. Total Grade

Add up all the scores from the above 5 Categories and report it below.

The Total Grade is: 9 points



# 8. Detailed Constructive Comments

I don't have that many things to add! I liked the presentation, the slides look nice and keep things at a suitable level (i.e., if I'm interested in some details it is clear where to find them, you focus on the flow and how you used them). Regarding the project repository I was a bit confused first, but you did have a map of it so now it is much clearer. I wonder if there are files that are not used? At least one of the notebooks contained cells that had crashed! The code was good, well commented (the stuff you guys wrote, I suppose certain things is from the microsam repo? At least it seems (haven't checked carefully) like the code is very similar to what is in the original microsam repo) Regarding scalability, it is by construction scalable, right? 

The one comment I have is in the originality of the project, maybe I don't understand it correctly, but it would seem like you take an existing framework and use ray on it, so I cannot see that it "The project seems to have tackled a very challenging problem and has made
significant contributions to aid other researchers or practitioners in a particular
domain of expertise.".
