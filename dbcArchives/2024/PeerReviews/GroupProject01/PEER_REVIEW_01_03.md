File name convention: It could be also good to add the label of case S1,S2 and S3 at the file name (only the datasets 2,3,4 is mentioned at the file names).
Result discussion: It could be also good to add desctiption about the reasons why each dataset gives large variations in the F1-score at difference settings (S1,S2,S3) i.e. da_ddt gives 82, 86, 80 F1-score in setting S1,S2 and S3.
