# Peer-review of ScaDaMaLe Student Group Project Number 1 (Jennifer Andersson, Kätriin Kukk, Lovisa Hagström, Thibault Marette)

# Reviewer

Choose one of the following option: 

- Michele Di Sabato

# 1. Live/Video Presentation

- 2 : The presentation was easily comprehensible and it helped me follow the project easily. I think I can definitely use the codes in the repository and adapt them if I were to encounter similar problems in the future, with possibly more in-depth self-study as needed.

# 2. Structure of Project Repository

The structure of the codes, including directory structure and coding/software-engineering practices, were  

- 1 : Reasonably organised and could be improved (please consider making suggestions for improvement in Section 8 below) for easier comprehension.

# 3. Comments and explanations in code:

- 2 : The code was well-commented so I could easily follow what was happening in most code blocks.

# 4. Originality or Difficulty of the Project

- 2 : The project seems to have tackled a very challenging problem and has made significant contributions to aid other researchers or practitioners in a particular domain of expertise.

# 5. Scalability of the Project

- 2 : The project is truly implementing a *scalable data science process* and the same code can work with arbitrarily large input data if enough computing resources are available.

# 6. Total Grade

Add up all the scores from the above 5 Categories and report it below.

The Total Grade is: 9

# 8. Detailed Constructive Comments

Comments on "2. Structure of Project Repository": the structure of the repository is very reader-friendly thanks to the 'README.md' file and especially the section titled '2. Repository Structure'. The comments in the scripts within the 'src' folder provide just the right amount of detail to understand what most parts of each script do. If I ever need to work with the Flower framework in the future, this repository would be a great starting point!

My only suggestion is that I found myself a bit unsure about the purpose of each script in the 'src' folder while reading the code for the first time. This was likely because I'm not very familiar with the Flower framework, which is explained well in the 'FederatedNER_report.ipynb' notebook. Including some of the markdown cells from this notebook in the 'README.md' file (perhaps in the '2. Repository Structure' section) could make the repository even clearer, since it would help readers quickly understand the role of each script within the Flower framework. Alternatively, adding a brief description of each script’s purpose directly at the start of the scripts in the 'src' folder could also work well. 

A final (minor) comment: the links to the quickstart example and complete example in section 3 of the README.md don't seem to point to the actual quickstart and complete examples, instead they redirect to the main page of the repository.
