# Peer-review of ScaDaMaLe Student Group Project Federated Learning for Music Recommendation Systems (https://github.com/Carriewenyangyang/scalable-data-science-project-group/tree/main)

# Reviewer

# 1. Live/Video Presentation

- 2 : The presentation was easily comprehensible and it helped me follow the project easily. I think I can definitely use the codes in the repository and adapt them if I were to encounter similar problems in the future, with possibly more in-depth self-study as needed.

# 2. Structure of Project Repository

- 2 : Extremely organised and easily comprehensible and/or replicable.

# 3. Comments and explanations in code:

- 2 : The code was well-commented so I could easily follow what was happening in most code blocks.

# 4. Originality or Difficulty of the Project

- 2 : The project seems to have tackled a very challenging problem and has made significant contributions to aid other researchers or practitioners in a particular domain of expertise.

# 5. Scalability of the Project

- 2 : The project is truly implementing a *scalable data science process* and the same code can work with arbitrarily large input data if enough computing resources are available.

# 6. Total Grade

The Total Grade is: 10

# 8. Detailed Constructive Comments

The repository is very well-structured and easy to navigate, and I would feel confident to replicate your project or create a similar project with FedN using your step-by-step guide. 
I appreciate the guide at the end of the README, and that the subfolders have their own README that are referred to. This made it easy to navigate the repository.
I really enjoyed your presentation, and it gave a great overview of the different parts of the project. The demonstration of federated learning for music recommender systems using the practical experimental setup you describe
clearly demonstrates the scalability of the project setup and implementation. 

You describe most parts really well, but I believe that the README would benefit from a more explicit motivation for using federated learning. 
Specifically, it would be helpful to explain why you chose federated learning for this music recommender system rather than other distributed training approaches.
As I understand it, your current method for dividing the dataset between clients seems to be an IID split of a large centralized dataset. In contrast, a real-world federated learning setting often involves inherently decentralized and non-IID data, such as private playlists from different users.
I suggest to briefly say something about these aspects in the README. To improve the repository, I think you can expand the README with a short problem introduction, including introducing the dataset, motivation for using federated learning, and briefly introducing the data distribution between the clients. 
I also suggest to include some results and a short discussion of them in the README, as only presentation slides are a bit tricky for gaining a comprehensive overview. 

Overall, great work on this project!
