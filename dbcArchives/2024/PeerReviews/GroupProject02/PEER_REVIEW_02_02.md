# Peer-review of ScaDaMaLe Student Group Project Number 3

# Reviewer


- Newton Mwai Kinyanjui

# 1. Live/Video Presentation

- 1 : The presentation was reasonably comprehensible and it helped me follow the codes and explanations relatively easily.

# 2. Structure of Project Repository

The structure of the codes, including directory structure and coding/software-engineering practices,  were  

- 2 : Extremely organised and easily comprehensible and/or replicable.

# 3. Comments and explanations in code:


- 2 : The code was well-commented so I could easily follow what was happening in most code blocks.

# 4. Originality or Difficulty of the Project


- 1 : The project is similar to an existing openly available project but significant contributions seem to be made in software versions, data used, explanations given and conclusions reached.

# 5. Scalability of the Project


- 2 : The project is truly implementing a *scalable data science process* and the same code can work with arbitrarily large input data if enough computing resources are available.

# 6. Total Grade

The Total Grade is: 8


# 8. Detailed Constructive Comments

This was one of the more interesting projects that caught my eye during the presentation as I hadn't come across recommendation systems with bipartite graphs before. Although as I mentioned during the presentation, I found the set-up somewhat constrained. I especially wondered if a content-based filtering is possible too, plus then you would actually need a scalable setup with high dimensional features.
My federated learning knowledge is limited, but great to see that you managed to set up FedN had shell scripts to run your workflows.
I think the repo is quite clean so no major concerns there.

Overall good job, super interesting formulation!
