# Peer-review of ScaDaMaLe Student Group Project Number <XY>

# Reviewer

Choose one of the following option: 
 
- Derya Akbaba

This is a brief template to guide you through the peer-review process.
It is meant to make recommendations for assigning between 0 and 10 points as a grade.
This grade will be used to decide the *Best Group Project Prize*.

Note that your feedback will be valuable to the course instructor, Raazesh Sainudiin (Raaz).
But more crucially, it can help improve the presentation of the project so the group can take your suggestions to improve the final version that will be published by the end of the course in:

- https://lamastex.github.io/ScaDaMaLe/

IMPORTANT: The decision of whether a group project meets the minimal requirements to pass the course (this is just a Pass/Fail course) will be made by your instructor by taking your peer-review into account.

# Set-up and Overview

- Go to the public link for the Group Project repository that you have been assigned to for your peer-review.
- You will be doing the peer-review constructively (You may clone the repository and try out codes yourself).
- Recall/watch the live/video presentation and go through the repository according to the below guidelines.
- You will be giving points under various categories and you have to report the final grade in the Course Canvas page.
- Please attach the completed version of this template plain text markdown file `PEER_REVIEW.md` to  Canvas to complete the peer-review by the deadline.

# 4. Originality or Difficulty of the Project

Choose one of the following options:

- 1 : The project is similar to an existing openly available project but significant contributions seem to be made in software versions, data used, explanations given and conclusions reached.

# 5. Scalability of the Project

Choose one of the following options:

- 2 : The project is truly implementing a *scalable data science process* and the same code can work with arbitrarily large input data if enough computing resources are available.

# 6. Total Grade

# 8. Detailed Constructive Comments

Please feel free to make detailed comments here in a constructive manner to help the group you are reviewing, so that they can make their presentation much better for the ScaDaMaLe-WASP Peer-reviewed Group Projects.

**Presentation Comments**
- There was perhaps too much detail for an overview about the embedding matrix.
- The images for the federated architecture were great.
- The presentation kind of just ended, so a conclusion would have been nice.

**Project Comments**
I am not sure If the objective of the project (creating playlist recomendations) was actually ever accomplished. Instead, it seems like the project just created sets of songs that are likely to be placed together rather than recommendations based on a persons interests of songs.
