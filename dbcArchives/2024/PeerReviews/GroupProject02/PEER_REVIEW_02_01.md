This project trained a GNN for music recommendation based on FedN. Generally speaking, the project is interesting, well-organized, and scalable. Some suggestions are listed below.

- The project introduced well regarding the model, the FedN, and the implementation. Relatively speaking, the introduction to the specific task, i.e., the music recommendation, could have more details.
- The presentation mentioned the vulnerabilities of federated learning. Providing some experiment results under attacks could enhance the advancement and completeness of this project.
