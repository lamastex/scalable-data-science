# 1. Live/Video Presentation

Recall/watch the live/video presentation carefully and decide on a score between 0 and 2.

2 : The presentation was easily comprehensible and it helped me follow the project easily. I think I can definitely use the codes in the repository and adapt them if I were to encounter similar problems in the future, with possibly more in-depth self-study as needed.

# 2. Structure of Project Repository

The structure of the codes, including directory structure and coding/software-engineering practices,  were  

2 : Extremely organised and easily comprehensible and/or replicable.

# 3. Comments and explanations in code:

1 : There were minimal comments in the code but the markdown/documentation explained briefly what the code was supposed to be doing at least at a high level.

# 4. Originality or Difficulty of the Project

2 : The project seems to have tackled a very challenging problem and has made significant contributions to aid other researchers or practitioners in a particular domain of expertise.

# 5. Scalability of the Project

2 : The project is truly implementing a *scalable data science process* and the same code can work with arbitrarily large input data if enough computing resources are available.

# 6. Total Grade

Add up all the scores from the above 5 Categories and report it below.

The Total Grade is: 9

# 7. Completing Peer-review Process

- Add this **Total Grade** as an integer to the LMS/Studium to complete your peer-review by the deadline.
- Attach you completed version of this file `PEER_REVIEW.md` to the LMS to complete the peer-review by the deadline.

# 8. Detailed Constructive Comments

Please feel free to make detailed comments here in a constructive manner to help the group you are reviewing, so that they can make their presentation much better for the ScaDaMaLe-WASP Peer-reviewed Group Projects.

- Comments and explanations in code
    - The code under `fedn-lightgcn/client` is well-commented while the code under `lightgcn.py` and `data-processing` lacks docstrings. It would be good if you ensured that the non-federated code also is well-explained with comments etc.
