# Peer-review of ScaDaMaLe Student Group Project Number 11

# Reviewer

Thibault Marette



# 1. Live/Video Presentation

- 2 : The presentation was easily comprehensible and it helped me follow the project easily. I think I can definitely use the codes in the repository and adapt them if I were to encounter similar problems in the future, with possibly more in-depth self-study as needed.

# 2. Structure of Project Repository

- 2 : Extremely organised and easily comprehensible and/or replicable.

# 3. Comments and explanations in code:

- 1 : There were minimal comments in the code but the markdown/documentation explained briefly what the code was supposed to be doing at least at a high level.

# 4. Originality or Difficulty of the Project


- 2 : The project seems to have tackled a very challenging problem and has made significant contributions to aid other researchers or practitioners in a particular domain of expertise.

# 5. Scalability of the Project

- 2 : The project is truly implementing a *scalable data science process* and the same code can work with arbitrarily large input data if enough computing resources are available.

# 6. Total Grade

Add up all the scores from the above 5 Categories and report it below.

The Total Grade is: 9

# 7. Completing Peer-review Process

- Add this **Total Grade** as an integer to the LMS/Studium to complete your peer-review by the deadline.
- Attach you completed version of this file `PEER_REVIEW.md` to the LMS to complete the peer-review by the deadline.

# 8. Detailed Constructive Comments

The experiments are extensive and uses synthetic dataset to exhibit the scalable feature of the code, but it would also have been interesting to see how the code behave on real-life data. In the presentation, a bit more time could have been spent on the problem setting. It was quite fast and had too much details to be understood in one/two slides (more problem setting and less implementation details would reach a nicer balance - for a presentation). The code base is lacking some structure overview and comments. The variable name are clear and explicit, but some documentation would have been very appreciated.

Good luck on the paper submission! :)
