# Peer-review of ScaDaMaLe Student Group Project Number 12 (Eric Olsson, Hantang Zhang, Huaifeng Zhang, Qi Shao)

# Reviewer

- Michele Di Sabato 

# 1. Live/Video Presentation

- 1 : The presentation was reasonably comprehensible and it helped me follow the codes and explanations relatively easily.

# 2. Structure of Project Repository

The structure of the codes, including directory structure and coding/software-engineering practices,  were  

- 1 : Reasonably organised and could be improved (please consider making suggestions for improvement in Section 8 below) for easier comprehension.

# 3. Comments and explanations in code:

- 2 : There were minimal comments in the code but the markdown/documentation explained briefly what the code was supposed to be doing at least at a high level.

# 4. Originality or Difficulty of the Project

- 2 : The project seems to have tackled a very challenging problem and has made significant contributions to aid other researchers or practitioners in a particular domain of expertise.

# 5. Scalability of the Project

- 2 : The project is truly implementing a *scalable data science process* and the same code can work with arbitrarily large input data if enough computing resources are available.

# 6. Total Grade

The Total Grade is: 8

# 7. Completing Peer-review Process

# 8. Detailed Constructive Comments

- Comments on "1. Live/Video Presentation": I found it a bit hard to follow the presentation because I couldnâ€™t read the report clearly from where I was sitting, so I had to rely only on the speech. Also, the pace felt a little fast for my level of understanding of the topic, so it was hard to keep up with all the information. Maybe slowing down a bit or making the deliverables easier to read from a distance could have helped make the presentation clearer.
- Comments on "2. Structure of Project Repository" and "3. Comments and explanations in code": The file named 'final_project_report.ipynb' is extremely well documented and very reader-friendly: it includes many examples and each cell block is introduced with a proper description. I did feel that it lacked a detailed project description, but the first part of the 'README.md' does a good job providing information about the goals of the project. The structure of the repository, however, is a bit confusing, since some files don't seem directly related to the project (such as 'Untitled.ipynb', 'hw4.ipynb', the 'src' folder, the 'test' folder). Cleaning up unnecessary files or including more details in the 'README.md' about the purpose of these files would make the repository much easier to navigate. A final (minor) comment: It could be good to give more attention to the 'decentralized_machine_learning.pdf' presentation. Currently it is only mentioned briefly in a small section of the notebook 'final_project_report.ipynb' and giving it a bit more focus (by inlcuding it in a new section in the 'README.md', for example) could help show why it's important to the project.
