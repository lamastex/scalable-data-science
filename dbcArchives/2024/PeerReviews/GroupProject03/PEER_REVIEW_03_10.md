    "Note that your feedback will be valuable to the course instructor, Raazesh Sainudiin (Raaz).\n",

    "\n",
    "- Go to the public link for the Group Project repository that you have been assigned to for your peer-review.\n",
    "- You will be doing the peer-review constructively (You may clone the repository and try out codes yourself).\n",
    "- Recall/watch the live/video presentation and go through the repository according to the below guidelines.\n",
    "- You will be giving points under various categories and you have to report the final grade in the Course Canvas page.\n",
    "- Please attach the completed version of this template plain text markdown file `PEER_REVIEW.md` to  Canvas to complete the peer-review by the deadline.\n",

    "Recall/watch the live/video presentation carefully and decide on a score between 0 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose one of the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0 : The presentation was completely incomprehensible after accounting for my background knowledge or lack thereof. \n",
    "- 1 : The presentation was reasonably comprehensible and it helped me follow the codes and explanations relatively easily.\n",
    "- 2 : The presentation was easily comprehensible and it helped me follow the project easily. I think I can definitely use the codes in the repository and adapt them if I were to encounter similar problems in the future, with possibly more in-depth self-study as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: 1.5\n",
    "The presentation did a good gob explaining the project's goals, methodology, and single-machine results. It highlighted key innovations like using SAM, adapting micro-SAM fine-tuning strategies, and bringing in Ray for distributed training on large microscopy datasets. However, it didn't show how Ray's distributed training actually improved scalability, focusing mainly on results from a single machine. Also, the long GitHub ReadMe screenshots were a bit too much - condensing it into a single slide with key points would have worked better.\n",

    "# 2. Structure of Project Repository\n",

    "The structure of the codes, including directory structure and coding/software-engineering practices,  were  \n",
    "\n",
    "Choose one of the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0 : Extremely poorly organised and incomprehensible.\n",
    "- 1 : Reasonably organised and could be improved (please consider making suggestions for improvement in Section 8 below) for easier comprehension.\n",
    "- 2 : Extremely organised and easily comprehensible and/or replicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: 1.2\n",
    "The project has a clear structure with complete code, but the documentation could use more details. For example, it doesn't explain the hardware requirements or the steps for distributed fine-tuning with Ray. While the README mentions using Ray for distributed training with large-scale microscopy datasets, the code actually uses the HPA dataset, and there's no explanation of why this dataset was chosen. Additionally, there are no Ray distributed configuration files or complete training scripts provided. Overall, the project shows great innovation, but the lack of detailed explanations makes it a bit harder to fully understand and replicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Comments and explanations in code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose one of the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0 : There were no comments at all in the code and not enough markdown/documentation explaining what the code was supposed to be doing. \n",
    "- 1 : There were minimal comments in the code but the markdown/documentation explained briefly what the code was supposed to be doing at least at a high level.\n",
    "- 2 : The code was well-commented so I could easily follow what was happening in most code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: 1.3 The project's code is clean and easy to navigate, but it lacks detailed explanations, which can lead to bugs and confusion. For example, the path  cd /storage/raysam_user/ray-sam doesn’t exist in the GitHub repository, likely due to a typo. Additionally, the Docker instructions are incomplete, as running the provided commands results in a \"killed\" error. A section outlining the hardware requirements, especially for GPU usage, would help users avoid such issues. Including a prerequisites section to outline the necessary setup before running Docker would be helpful. Moreover, it would improve readability if the virtual environment setup were introduced earlier in the documentation to create a smoother flow.\n",

    "# 4. Originality or Difficulty of the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose one of the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0 : The project is just a minor adaptation (less than 10%) of an existing openly available project that is very close to this, including data analysed, tools used, identical versions of software, and conclusions reached.\n",
    "- 1 : The project is similar to an existing openly available project but significant contributions seem to be made in software versions, data used, explanations given and conclusions reached.\n",
    "- 2 : The project seems to have tackled a very challenging problem and has made significant contributions to aid other researchers or practitioners in a particular domain of expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: 1.5\n",
    "The project effectively tackles a challenging technical problem by leveraging Meta AI's SAM model and the Ray framework for distributed training, demonstrating solid scalability. The choice of the HPA dataset is appropriate, though it is a public dataset and not particularly unique compared to other projects. While Docker and Kubernetes provide flexibility, they are not entirely new concepts for those familiar with distributed systems. Overall, the project is both challenging and original, but some aspects, like the use of familiar tools, may not feel entirely new.\n",

    "# 5. Scalability of the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose one of the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0 : The project is not at all scalable. There is no need to do this project in a distributed computing environment (explain in Section 8 below why you think so).  \n",
    "- 1 : The project has some scalable aspects or ideas on how scalability can be achieved. \n",
    "- 2 : The project is truly implementing a *scalable data science process* and the same code can work with arbitrarily large input data if enough computing resources are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: 1\n",
    "The project is theoretically scalable because it uses Ray and SAM for distributed training, but there isn't enough implementation or results provided to actually demonstrate how it scales in practice.\n",

    "# 6. Total Grade\n",

    "Add up all the scores from the above 5 Categories and report it below.\n",

    "# 8. Detailed Constructive Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback:\n",
    "First of all, great job tackling a complex problem with the use of Meta Ai's SAM model and the Ray framework for distributed training. The idea behind this project is promsing. A lot of effort must be put into setting up the infrastructure for distributed training, particularly with Docker and Kubernetes. Here are some points summarized that might help improve the project further:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Documentation: The code is pretty clear, but it would be really helpful to add more comments, especially around the distributed training setup. That would make it easier for people who aren’t familiar with the technologies to follow along and understand your thought process.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Dataset Confusion: The Readme talks about using Ray to scale SAM for large microscopy datasets, but then the code seems to be using a different dataset than what’s mentioned. It would be great if you could clarify which dataset is being used, so things don’t feel inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Results: You mention scalability as a key feature, but there aren’t enough results or examples showing how the system performs when scaled up. It would be awesome to see some performance data or visuals that demonstrate how well it handles larger datasets in a distributed setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Structure of the Readme: It might help if you moved the virtual environment setup instructions (like creating a conda environment) higher up in the Readme. This way, people can quickly get up and running without having to dig through the whole document.\n",
    "\n",
    "(5)Hardware Requirements: Even though you’re using Docker, it would be useful to mention any hardware requirements or recommendations. For example, how much memory or GPU power would someone need to run the system effectively?\n",
    "Overall, it is a very promising project with a lot of potential. With a bit more clarity in the doucmentation and some results showing how it scales, this could be even better!"
