# Peer-review of ScaDaMaLe Student Group Project Number 3

# Reviewer


- Newton Mwai Kinyanjui

# 1. Live/Video Presentation

- 2 : The presentation was easily comprehensible and it helped me follow the project easily. I think I can definitely use the codes in the repository and adapt them if I were to encounter similar problems in the future, with possibly more in-depth self-study as needed.

# 2. Structure of Project Repository

The structure of the codes, including directory structure and coding/software-engineering practices,  were  

- 1 : Reasonably organised and could be improved (please consider making suggestions for improvement in Section 8 below) for easier comprehension.

# 3. Comments and explanations in code:


- 2 : The code was well-commented so I could easily follow what was happening in most code blocks.

# 4. Originality or Difficulty of the Project


- 1 : The project is similar to an existing openly available project but significant contributions seem to be made in software versions, data used, explanations given and conclusions reached.

# 5. Scalability of the Project


- 2 : The project is truly implementing a *scalable data science process* and the same code can work with arbitrarily large input data if enough computing resources are available.

# 6. Total Grade

The Total Grade is: 8


# 8. Detailed Constructive Comments

I really enjoyed reviewing your project. It seems very aligned with high workloads that could come about in segmenting large medical images which are typically large.
However, I would encourage you to further reorganize the repo, it was a bit hard to navigate and find the various components, mainly because there are several modules for different  
It's nice that you have centralized the notebooks, but it would be great to have a decoupled single viable setup with reproduible configurations (e.g. yaml files containing parameters, and execution scripts) for an easy start-up if one is just looking to try raysam out.
Maybe also improve the showcasing of your segmentation results :)

Good job!
