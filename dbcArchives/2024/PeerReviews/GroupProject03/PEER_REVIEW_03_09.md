# Peer-review of ScaDaMaLe Student Group Project 4

# Reviewer

Erik Jansson 

# Set-up and Overview

- Go to the public link for the Group Project repository that you have been assigned to for your peer-review.
- You will be doing the peer-review constructively (You may clone the repository and try out codes yourself).
- Recall/watch the live/video presentation and go through the repository according to the below guidelines.
- You will be giving points under various categories and you have to report the final grade in the Course Canvas page.
- Please attach the completed version of this template plain text markdown file `PEER_REVIEW.md` to  Canvas to complete the peer-review by the deadline.

# 1. Live/Video Presentation

1 point: The presentation was reasonably comprehensible and it helped me follow the codes and explanations relatively easily.


# 2. Structure of Project Repository

The structure of the codes, including directory structure and coding/software-engineering practices,  were  

1 point:  Reasonably organised and could be improved (please consider making suggestions for improvement in Section 8 below) for easier comprehension.



# 3. Comments and explanations in code:


- 2 points : The code was well-commented so I could easily follow what was happening in most code blocks.

# 4. Originality or Difficulty of the Project

2 points: 
The project seems to have tackled a very challenging problem and has made significant contributions to aid other researchers or practitioners in a particular domain of expertise.


# 5. Scalability of the Project


- 1 : The project has some scalable aspects or ideas on how scalability can be achieved. 
- 2 : The project is truly implementing a *scalable data science process* and the same code can work with arbitrarily large input data if enough computing resources are available.

# 6. Total Grade


The Total Grade is: 8 points


# 8. Detailed Constructive Comments

Regarding presentation (1) I really liked the presentation. It started out  clear and "motivation-motivated", something I appreciate. However, when discussing the technical details in the latter parts of the presentation, I felt a bit left behind in the dust. Maybe more time should have been spent trying to explain the basic idea rather than to focus on the details (as I felt was the case), it was hard for me to follow some of the details. 

Regarding project structure (2)

The structure was a bit hard for me to follow. It seems like some files appear more than once, in several different folders, I find this confusing, for instance the files in the data folder. Perhaps it would be possible to collect all the code that is reused and just import it when needed rather than to hard copy the files every time. I struggled a bit to find where experiments were made. Maybe one folder with all the relevant reused code that is then imported into a programs in an "experiments" folder?

Regarding code comments (3)
No comments from mee! Comments were good 


Regarding originality (4)
To my (untrained) eye, it seems like this project does something quite novel. 
It is certainly a challenging project, but it manages to build on previous work to make it scalable, and it would seem, to integrate some more modern frameworks and methods, so it is a clear 2 to me. 


Regarding scalability (5)
No comments, it is scalable by construction!
