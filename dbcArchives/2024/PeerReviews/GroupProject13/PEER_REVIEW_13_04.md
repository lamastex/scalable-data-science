# 8. Detailed Constructive Comments

The presentation was nice looking and pretty good, but in my opinion went on for a little too long and with too little focus on the scalability (maybe it had to do with the one presenting that part being online).

The structure of the project repository is excellent. There are very detailed instructions on how to use the project, and an in-depth description in the report of what was done during the project.

The code is very well described and easily understandable. Being able to fit almost everything in a single file makes it easier to understand the entire project.

The project does not seem particularly difficult but makes a nice inclusion to use Spark (important for the course), which very few other projects did.

Overall, the project was well done, excellently documented and easy to follow but in my opinion focused too little on scalability.
