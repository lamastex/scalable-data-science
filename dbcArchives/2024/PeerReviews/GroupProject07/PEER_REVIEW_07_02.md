    "It is meant to make recommendations for assigning between 0 and 10 points as a grade.\n",
    "This grade will be used to decide the *Best Group Project Prize*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that your feedback will be valuable to the course instructor, Raazesh Sainudiin (Raaz).\n",

    "# Set-up and Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to the public link for the Group Project repository that you have been assigned to for your peer-review.\n",
    "- You will be doing the peer-review constructively (You may clone the repository and try out codes yourself).\n",
    "- Recall/watch the live/video presentation and go through the repository according to the below guidelines.\n",
    "- You will be giving points under various categories and you have to report the final grade in the Course Canvas page.\n",
    "- Please attach the completed version of this template plain text markdown file `PEER_REVIEW.md` to  Canvas to complete the peer-review by the deadline.\n",

    "# 1. Live/Video Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall/watch the live/video presentation carefully and decide on a score between 0 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose one of the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0 : The presentation was completely incomprehensible after accounting for my background knowledge or lack thereof. \n",
    "- 1 : The presentation was reasonably comprehensible and it helped me follow the codes and explanations relatively easily.\n",
    "- 2 : The presentation was easily comprehensible and it helped me follow the project easily. I think I can definitely use the codes in the repository and adapt them if I were to encounter similar problems in the future, with possibly more in-depth self-study as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: 1.5\n",
    "The presentation demonstrated great technical depth and originality, covering everything from the background to results. However, the slides were text-heavy, and the presentation ran overtime, making it tough to keep up, especially in a class setting. Some complex ideas, like the AllReduce bottleneck, could have used clearer visuals. I might be nitpicking here, but simplifying the content, cutting down on text, and using more visuals would make the presentation easier to follow and more engaging. It would definitely help the audience understand better.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Structure of Project Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the codes, including directory structure and coding/software-engineering practices,  were  \n",
    "\n",
    "Choose one of the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0 : Extremely poorly organised and incomprehensible.\n",
    "- 1 : Reasonably organised and could be improved (please consider making suggestions for improvement in Section 8 below) for easier comprehension.\n",
    "- 2 : Extremely organised and easily comprehensible and/or replicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: 1\n",
    "The project is generally well-organized, with clear setup instructions and most of the necessary components included. However, there are some areas for improvement. For example, the wandb tutorial, while helpful, adds unnecessary learning burden for the audience. Instead of a generic guide, it would be more user-friendly to directly show how to log into the project, navigate it, and view dataset-specific results. This would save time and avoid unecessary confusion. Additionally, the las of a requirements.txt or similar setup file makes replication a bit more difficult than it needs to be. If I'm being too picky, I apologize. I do appreciate the technical depth of your project but have evaluated it from the perspective of practicality and ease of use, hoping to better support the audience, especially in fostering collaboration and understanding.\n",

    "# 3. Comments and explanations in code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose one of the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0 : There were no comments at all in the code and not enough markdown/documentation explaining what the code was supposed to be doing. \n",
    "- 1 : There were minimal comments in the code but the markdown/documentation explained briefly what the code was supposed to be doing at least at a high level.\n",
    "- 2 : The code was well-commented so I could easily follow what was happening in most code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: 0\n",
    "The code is very clean but lacks comments or explanations. There's no commentary on the logic, data loading, training, or the design behind it. Even the distributed training setup is missiong, making it difficult to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Originality or Difficulty of the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose one of the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0 : The project is just a minor adaptation (less than 10%) of an existing openly available project that is very close to this, including data analysed, tools used, identical versions of software, and conclusions reached.\n",
    "- 1 : The project is similar to an existing openly available project but significant contributions seem to be made in software versions, data used, explanations given and conclusions reached.\n",
    "- 2 : The project seems to have tackled a very challenging problem and has made significant contributions to aid other researchers or practitioners in a particular domain of expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: 2\n",
    "Given the project's high technical depth and innovation (e.g., introducing Federated Learning and Dcentralized Training) to solve real-world problems like road surface classification, it tackles complex issues with significant contributions. It's not just a minor adaptation of an existing project but a challenging and original approach that adds value to the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Scalability of the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose one of the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0 : The project is not at all scalable. There is no need to do this project in a distributed computing environment (explain in Section 8 below why you think so).  \n",
    "- 1 : The project has some scalable aspects or ideas on how scalability can be achieved. \n",
    "- 2 : The project is truly implementing a *scalable data science process* and the same code can work with arbitrarily large input data if enough computing resources are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: 2\n",
    "The use of A40 and A100 shows the project is designed to scale with additional computing resources. The distributed setup and high-performance hardware suggest it can handle larger datasets, reflecting scalability in data science. \n",

    "# 6. Total Grade\n",
    "\n",
    "Add up all the scores from the above 5 Categories and report it below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Total Grade is: 6.5\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Completing Peer-review Process\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add this **Total Grade** as an integer to the LMS/Studium to complete your peer-review by the deadline.\n",

    "# 8. Detailed Constructive Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Please feel free to make detailed comments here in a constructive manner to help the group you are reviewing, so that they can make their presentation much better for the ScaDaMaLe-WASP Peer-reviewed Group Projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback:\n",
    "(1) Structure of Project Repository: The project is pretty well-organized, but it could really use some convenience files like requirements.txt to make replication easier. The wandb tutorial is nice, but it might be better to show how to log into the project directly and view results specific to the dataset instead of leaving users to figure it out themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Comments and Explanations in Code: The code is clean, but it’s a bit sparse on comments. Adding more explanations, especially around data loading, training, and the distributed training setup, would make it much easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Originality and Difficulty: Good work! The project tackles a tough problem with some impressive technical depth, especially with federated learning and decentralized training. It’s a great contribution to the field, especially around privacy issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Scalability: The use of A40 and A100 GPUs shows great scalability. The project can handle larger datasets as long as you have the computing resources, which is a good sign for scaling up.\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Presentation: The content is strong, but the presentation could be made a bit easier to follow. Cutting down on text-heavy slides and adding more visuals to explain complex ideas would help make the presentation more digestible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, good work, the project is very thorough in addressing all aspects, but these improvements could make it even better for users and collaborators!\n",
