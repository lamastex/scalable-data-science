# 8. Comments

- Related to point 2. : For more clarity, describe the directory layout and the purpose of key files and folders.
- Related to point 3. : Mention in your report early on that you call your apprcoch "Decent" and  you compare to All-Reduce as a baseline
- Related to point 3. :Provide more details on the methods and algorithms used in the project. The methods has three sections that look kind of independent from each other. For better readability, maybe add a paragraph in the beggining of "Method" explaining an overview of the method and what each sub-section describes. Include a short explanations of any data analysis or pre-processing steps.
- Related to point 3. : There are some terms used in the method that are not defined (global and local parameters, All-Reduce, Exponential Ring, etc.)  either define them beforehand or show the, better in the figure.
- Related to point 3. : explian federated learning in more details or use a figure to show how it works.
- Related to point 4. : I could not rate the the originality of the project properly due to lack of proper conclusions and analysis. Without these the work seems like a minor adaptation of an existing openly available project.  For a higher grade in "Originality", please try to clarfy better what your contributions and conclusions where. Consider adding a proper conclusion/discussion section (and maybe future work section).
- Add refferences and citations to works, images and formulas you took from relevant papers and blogs
