    "The two sets for inputs and outputs are traditionally called *domain* and *range* or *codomain*, respectively. \n",

    "The map or function associates each element in the domain with exactly one element in the range.  \n",

Each daughter maps to a father (there is no immaculate conceptions here!).  More than one daughter can map to the same father (some fathers have more daughters!).

Lots of keys can map to the same image value ($Jenny$ and $Cathy$ have the same father, $Anu$ and $Ashu$ have the same father), but the idea is that we can uniquely identify the value we want if we know the key.   This means that we can't have multiple identical keys.   This makes sense when you look at how the map works.   We use the map to find values from the key, as we did when we found $Anu$'s father above.   If we had more than one $Anu$ in the set of keys, we could not uniquely identify the value that maps to the key $Anu$.\n",

    "The origins of probability can be traced back to the 17th century.  It arose out of the study of gambling and games of chance.  Many well-known names associated with probability worked on problems to do with gambling:  people like Bernoulli and Pascal did quite a lot of work in this area ...  even Newton was persuaded to set down some of his thoughts about a game involving dice (in a letter to a Samuel Pepys). \n",

    "An **experiment** is an activity or procedure that produces distinct or well-defined outcomes.  The *set* of such outcomes is called the **sample space** of the experiment.  The sample space is usually denoted with the symbol $\\Omega$.  Lets look at some examples of experiments.\n",

    "If our experiment is to roll a dice wth faces painted $red$, $green$, $yellow$, $pink$, $blue$ and $black$ and find what colour the top face is at the end of each roll, then the sample space $\\Omega = \\{red, green, yellow, pink, blue, black\\}$.\n",

    "If our experiment is to flip a coin where the two faces of the coin can be identified as 'heads' ($H$) and 'tails' ($T$), and we are interested in what face lands uppermost, then the sample space is $\\Omega = \\{H, T\\}$.\n",
