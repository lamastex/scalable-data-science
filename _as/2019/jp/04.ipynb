    "When we introduced the subject of probability, we said that many famous people had become interested in it from the point of view of gambling.   Games of dice are one of the earliest forms of gambling (probably deriving from an even earlier game which involved throwing animal 'ankle' bones or astragali).   Galileo was one of those who wrote about dice, including an important piece which explained what many experienced gamblers had sensed but had not been able to formalise - the difference between the probability of throwing a 9 and the probability of throwing a 10 with two dice.  You should be able to see why this is from our map above.  If you are interested you can read a translation (Galileo wrote in Latin) of Galileo's Sorpa le Scoperte Dei Dadi.   This is also printed in a nice book, Games, Gods and Gambling by F.N. David (originally published 1962, newer editions now available).\n",

    "# Conditional statements\n",
    "\n",
    "A conditional statement is also known as an if statement or if-else statement.   And it's basically as simple as that:   if [some condition] is true then do [something].   To make it more powerful, we can also say else (ie, if not), then do [a different something].\n",
    "\n",
    "The if statement syntax is a way of putting into a programming language a way of thinking that we use every day:   E.g. \"if it is raining, I'll take the bus to uni; else I'll walk\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that when we have an if statement, what we do depends on whether the condition we specify is true or false (i.e. is conditional on this expression).   This is why if statements are called conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say \"depends on whether the condition we specify is true or false\", in SageMath terms we are talking about whether the expression we specify as our condition evaluates to the Boolean true or the Boolean false.   Remember those Boolean values, true and false, that we talked about in Lab 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "The SageMath syntax for a conditional statement including if and else clauses is explained below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with the keyword `if`\n",
    "- Immediately after keyword `if` we specify the condition that determines what happens next.   The condition therefore has to be the kind of truth statement we talked about in Lab 1, an expression which SageMath can evaluate as either Boolean `true` or Boolean `false`.   The examples below will make this a bit clearer.\n",
    "- After we have specified the condition, we end the line with a colon `:` before continuing to the next line.\n",
    "- Now, immediately below the line that starts if, we give the code that says what happens if the condition we specified is `true`.   This block of code called the `if`-block is indented so that SageMath can recognise that it should do everything in that block if the condition is `true`.   If the condition is `false`, SageMath will not go into this indented block to execute any of this code but instead look for the next line which is aligned with the original `if`, i.e. the next line which is not part of the `if`-block.\n",
    "- In some situations we only want do something if the condition is `true`, and there is nothing else we want to do if the condition is `false`.   In this situaion all we need is the `if`-block of code described above, the part that is executed only if the condition is `true`.   Then we can carry on with the rest of the program.   An everyday example would be \"if it is cold I will wear gloves\".\n",
    "- In some other situations, however, we also want to specify something to happen when the condition is `false` - with the `else`-block.   We specify this by following the `if`-block with the keyword `else`, aligned with the `if` so that SageMath knows this is where it jumps to when the `if` condition is `false`.   The keyword `else` is also followed by a colon `:`\n",
    "- Immediately below the line that starts `else`, we say what happens if the condition we specified is `false`.   Again, this block of code (the `else`-block) is indented so that SageMath can recognise that it should do everything in that block if the condition is `false`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that SageMath will either execute the code in the `if`-block or will execute the code in the `else`-block. What happens, i.e. which block gets executed,  depends on whether the condition evaluates to `true` or `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's set up a nice simple conditional statement and see what happens. We want take two variables, named `x` and `y`, and print something out only if `x` is greater than `y`.   The condition is `x > y`, and you can see that this evaluates to either `true` or `false`, depending on the values of `x` and `y`."
