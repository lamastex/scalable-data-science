This means that we can't have multiple identical keys.   This makes sense when you look at how the map works.   We use the map to find values from the key, as we did when we found $Anu$'s father above.

    "# Collections in Sage\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already talked about the SageMath and Python number types and a little about the string type.   You have also met sets in SageMath with a brief mention of lists.   A set and list in Sage are, loosely speaking, examples of collection types.   Collections are a useful idea: grouping or collecting together some data (or variables) so that we can refer to it and use it collectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMath provides quite a few collections.  One that we will meet very often is the list, [a built-in sequence type in Python](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-str-unicode-list-tuple-bytearray-buffer-xrange) like the strings we have already seen. See [Python tutorial for built-in data structures](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1: Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, a *list* in SageMath/Python is a *sequence type*.   This basically means that the order of the things in the list is imporant and we can use concepts related to ordering when we work with a list. More specifically, a list is a *mutable sequence type*. This just means that you can change or mutate the contents of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry about these details (unless you are interested in them of course and follow links below), but for now just look at the worksheet cells below to see how useful and flexible lists are.\n",

Many well-known names associated with probability worked on problems to do with gambling:  people like Bernoulli and Pascal did quite a lot of work in this area ...  even Newton was persuaded to set down some of his thoughts about a game involving dice (in a letter to a Samuel Pepys). \n",

That's basically what are going to use, but we 'wrap' up the dictionary in some extra code that does things like check that the probabilities add to 1, and that each element in the list of outcomes we have given is unique.   If you are interested in programming, we have coded our own type, or class, called `ProbyMap` (it's given in the next cell, and you can simply evaluate it and ignore all the details completely!).   Once the class is coded, we create a `ProbyMap` by providing the sample space and the probabilities.   You don't have to worry about how the class is implemented, but note that you may often want to use the computer to create a **computerised representation of a mathematical concept**.  Once the concept (a discrete probability map in our case) is implemenetd, then we can use the computer to automate the mundane tasks of large-scale computations.\n",
