We will mainly focus on the relation between the combinatorial geometric complexity of the (sigma) algebras of a simple measurable space and the rates of convergence of empirical measures over them in one of the simplest posable decision problems – nonparametric density estimation of an unknown density f in L1 based on finitely many observations drawn independently from it, but without making any mathematical compromise whatsoever, and thereby giving the so-called universal performance guarantee. This course was given in another form at CMAP, Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France for PhD students in mathematics there. Students in Geometry and Combinatorial probability as well as analysis may find this course insightful for their own research, as one of the basic theorems involves the combined use of several unique inequalities in a specific partial order of implications. The emphasis will involve constructive mathematics and perhaps delve into tree arithmetics towards such decision with universal performance guarantees along with their combinatorial, algebraic and analytic properties if time permits. Unfortunately such guarantees are not available for big data sets and may be necessary for being able to impose legal requirements and standards on automated decision-making systems.']

# [360-in-525-3: Geospatial Analytics and Big Data](https://lamastex.github.io/scalable-data-science/360-in-525/2018/03/) 
This is a two-full-days workshop (2 hp) on **May 3-4 2018**. Prerequisites: 360-in-525-1  or [Introduction to data Science](https://lamastex.github.io/scalable-data-science/sds/2/2/). The first day will be done by domain experts from Uppsala University's [Department of Social and Economic Geography](http://www.kultgeog.uu.se/?languageId=1) in order to introduce the basic problems and datasets of the field with hands-on lab tutorials in non-distributed geospatial analytics. 
The second day will be on distributed geospatial analytics over real datasets that can be scaled to petabytes (syllabus is jointly designed with experts in London's big data industry). 
Topics include efficient distributed spatial joins, ingestion and representations of Open Street Maps that are conducive to pregel-style distributed vertex programs, SparkSQL and Spark Machine Learning pipelines with spatiotemporal GPS trajectories of multiple individuals.
